Today my reason is: create an example daylogger.txt file for my README.md!


12:35:04-
	I updated the README to include setup for Linux and Windows.
	I learned how to add blocks of code that have a copy button on the right.
	My goal for the next hour is to make sure I can use the README to setup this script on my new Windows laptop.
